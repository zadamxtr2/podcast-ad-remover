# AI API User Guide

Podcast Ad Remover exposes an optional REST API for AI agents, custom GPT actions, scripts, and automation clients under `/api/v1`.

Use this API when you want an assistant to inspect podcasts, find episodes, read transcripts/reports, add feeds, or trigger processing without using the browser UI.

## Quick Start

1. Open **Admin > System Settings > AI API**.
2. Enable **AI API**.
3. Set default rate limits.
4. Create an API token.
5. Copy the token immediately. The full token is shown only once.

Example request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer par_REPLACE_ME" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/subscriptions
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer par_...
```

API tokens are different from feed tokens:

- API tokens control management and automation actions.
- Feed tokens only allow podcast clients to read protected feeds/audio.
- API token hashes are stored in SQLite; the full token is never stored.

Available scopes:

| Scope | Use this when the client should |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| `read` | Read podcasts, episodes, queue state, transcripts, reports, and search results. |
| `write` | Add subscriptions and update podcast settings. |
| `process` | Trigger feed checks, downloads, reprocessing, cancellation, and ignore actions. |
| `admin` | Read instance-level system status. |

For a general AI assistant, a practical token is usually `read`, `write`, and `process`. Add `admin` only when the assistant should inspect instance health.

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are SQLite-backed and survive app restarts.

- Authenticated requests are limited by token.
- Missing or invalid token attempts are limited by client IP.
- `429` responses include `Retry-After`.

Example rate-limit response:

```json
{
  "detail": "Rate limit exceeded"
}
```

When `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`, client IP detection uses trusted reverse-proxy headers. Only enable that setting behind a proxy that strips client-supplied forwarded headers.

## Common Workflows

### Let an AI answer "what podcasts do I have?"

Call:

```http
GET /api/v1/subscriptions
```

Required scope: `read`

Outcome: returns the podcast library the token can see.

### Let an AI summarize available episodes for a podcast

Call:

```http
GET /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/episodes?limit=20
```

Then, for any completed episode that has artifacts:

```http
GET /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/transcript
GET /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/report
```

Required scope: `read`

Outcome: the assistant can inspect episode metadata, transcript text, and ad-removal report data.

### Add a new podcast from an AI chat

Call:

```http
POST /api/v1/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "feed_url": "https://example.com/podcast/feed.xml",
  "initial_count": 5
}
```

Required scope: `write`

Outcome: the app parses the feed, creates or reuses the global subscription, and checks the newest episodes.

### Ask an AI to refresh a show

Call:

```http
POST /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/check
```

Required scope: `process`

Outcome: the app checks the feed for new episodes and queues normal processing work.

### Ask an AI to reprocess an episode

Call:

```http
POST /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/reprocess?skip_transcription=false
```

Required scope: `process`

Outcome: the app versions the current output, resets the episode, and queues processing.

Use `skip_transcription=true` only when an existing transcript should be reused.

## Discovery Endpoints

### Check API health

```http
GET /api/v1/health
```

Auth: none

Use this to confirm the app is reachable and whether the API is enabled.

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Read API capabilities

```http
GET /api/v1/capabilities
```

Auth: none, but the API must be enabled.

Use this to discover supported scopes and configured default limits.

Example response:

```json
{
  "name": "Podcast Ad Remover API",
  "version": "v1",
  "auth": "bearer",
  "scopes": ["read", "write", "process", "admin"],
  "rate_limits": {
    "default_requests_per_minute": 60,
    "default_requests_per_day": 1000,
    "unauth_requests_per_minute": 10
  }
}
```

### Read the OpenAPI schema

```http
GET /api/v1/openapi.json
```

Auth: none, but the API must be enabled.

Use this for clients that can import an OpenAPI schema.

## Read Endpoints

### Get system status

```http
GET /api/v1/system/status
```

Required scope: `admin`

Use this when an assistant needs operational health such as queue, storage, feed check, or system status summaries.

Example response shape:

```json
{
  "disk": {},
  "memory": {},
  "queue": {},
  "feeds": {}
}
```

The exact keys come from the app's operation status helper and may grow as the admin queue dashboard evolves.

### Get queue status

```http
GET /api/v1/queue
```

Required scope: `read`

Use this to answer "what is processing?", "what failed?", or "what recently completed?"

Example response shape:

```json
{
  "queue": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "title": "Episode title",
      "status": "processing",
      "job_status": "running",
      "processing_step": "transcribing",
      "progress": 35
    }
  ],
  "recently_processed": [],
  "operation_status": {}
}
```

### List subscriptions

```http
GET /api/v1/subscriptions
```

Required scope: `read`

Use this to list podcasts. If a token is associated with a user, only that user's library is returned. Shared/admin tokens return the global library.

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "feed_url": "https://example.com/feed.xml",
    "title": "Example Show",

    "owner_user_id": null,
    "retention_days": 30,
    "manual_retention_days": 14,
    "retention_limit": 1
  }
]
```

### Get one subscription

```http
GET /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}
```

Required scope: `read`

Use this when the assistant already knows the subscription id and needs settings or metadata.

Response: one subscription object, same shape as `GET /subscriptions`.

### List episodes for a subscription

```http
GET /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/episodes?limit=20&offset=0&search=topic
```

Required scope: `read`

Use this to page through episodes or search episode titles for a podcast.

Query parameters:

| Name | Default | Notes |

    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "search": "topic",
  "has_more": false
}
```

### Get one episode

```http
GET /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}

        "start": 0.0,
        "end": 4.2,
        "text": "Welcome to the episode."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If no transcript file exists, the response is `404`.

### Get an episode ad-removal report

```http
GET /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/report
```

Required scope: `read`

Use this to inspect what was removed, kept, or detected during processing.

Example JSON report response:

If only an HTML report exists, `content_type` is `text/html` and `report` is an HTML string.

## Search Endpoint

### Search for podcasts

```http
POST /api/v1/search
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "show name or topic"
}
```

Required scope: `read`

Use this before adding a new podcast when the user provides a show name instead of an RSS URL.

Example response shape:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Example Show",
    "feed_url": "https://example.com/feed.xml",
    "image_url": "https://example.com/art.jpg",
    "description": "Podcast description"
  }
]
```

## Write Endpoints

### Add a subscription

```http
POST /api/v1/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "feed_url": "https://example.com/feed.xml",
  "initial_count": 5
}
```

Required scope: `write`

Use this when a user asks an assistant to add a podcast by RSS URL.

Request fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `feed_url` | yes | Must be HTTP or HTTPS. |
| `initial_count` | no | Number of newest episodes to check initially. Default `5`, allowed `0..50`. |

Outcome:

- If the feed already exists, the existing subscription is returned.
- If the token is linked to a user, the existing show is added to that user's library.
- If it is new, the feed is parsed, saved, a new-podcast notification is sent, and initial feed checking starts.

Response: a subscription object.

### Update subscription settings

```http
PATCH /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/settings
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "remove_ads": true,
  "remove_promos": true,
  "remove_intros": false,
  "remove_outros": false,

  "ai_rewrite_description": false,
  "ai_audio_summary": false,
  "retention_days": 30,
  "manual_retention_days": 14,
  "retention_limit": 1
}
```

Required scope: `write`

Use this when a user asks an assistant to change how a podcast is processed.

All fields are optional. Omitted fields keep their current values.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "updated",
  "id": 1,
  "detail": null
}
```

The app also schedules cleanup and a feed check in the background.

## Processing Endpoints

### Check a subscription for new episodes

```http
POST /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/check
```

Required scope: `process`

Use this when a user asks "refresh this show" or "check for new episodes."

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "check_triggered",
  "id": 1,
  "detail": null
}
```

### Queue a manual episode download

```http
POST /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/download
```

Required scope: `process`

Use this when a user wants a specific episode downloaded and processed now.

Outcome: marks the episode as a manual download and queues it by setting status to `pending`.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "download_queued",
  "id": 10,
  "detail": null
}
```

### Reprocess an episode

```http
POST /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/reprocess?skip_transcription=false
```

Required scope: `process`

Use this after changing podcast settings or when an episode should be processed again.

Query parameters:

| Name | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `skip_transcription` | `false` | Set `true` to reuse an existing transcript when available. |

Outcome: versions the existing output, resets processing state, and queues the episode.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "reprocess_queued",
  "id": 10,
  "detail": null
}
```

If the episode is already processing:

```json

}
```

### Cancel queued or running work

```http
POST /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/cancel
```

Required scope: `process`

Use this when a user wants to stop queued/running work without deleting or ignoring the episode.

Outcome: active jobs are cancelled and the episode returns to `unprocessed`.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "cancelled",

  "detail": null
}
```

### Ignore an episode

```http
POST /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/ignore
```

Required scope: `process`

Use this when a user does not want an episode to appear in processed output.

Outcome: the app runs the same ignore/delete episode cleanup path used by the UI.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "ignored",
  "id": 10,
  "detail": null
}
```
