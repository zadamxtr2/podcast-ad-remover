# Deployment

Docker is the recommended deployment path.

## Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name podcast-ad-remover \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  -e BASE_URL=http://your-server-ip:8000 \
  jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest
```

### AMD GPU Support

For AMD GPU passthrough (e.g., Radeon 780M), add device mappings and seccomp unconfined (required for ctranslate2):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name podcast-ad-remover \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
  --device /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd \
  --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  -e BASE_URL=http://your-server-ip:8000 \
  jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest
```

The default image uses CPU-only PyTorch. To use AMD GPU acceleration, you may need to install ZLUDA or ROCm-compatible PyTorch inside the container.

For a production install, also set a unique `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`.
If users access the app through HTTPS behind a reverse proxy, set `COOKIE_SECURE=true`.
Only set `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` when that proxy strips any client-supplied forwarding headers before passing requests to the app.
For authenticated management access behind a reverse proxy, set `BASE_URL` or the System Settings public application URL to the browser-facing origin so same-origin checks accept legitimate form submissions.

## Docker Compose

Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` and the published image when running a normal install:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
    environment:
      - GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
      - BASE_URL=http://your-server-ip:8000
      - SESSION_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
      - LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### AMD GPU Support with Docker Compose

For AMD GPU passthrough, add device mappings and seccomp unconfined (required for ctranslate2) to your compose file:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
      - /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
    environment:
      - GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
      - BASE_URL=http://your-server-ip:8000
      - SESSION_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
      - LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Both `docker-compose.yml` (local development) and `docker-compose.prod.yml` (production) include these device mappings by default.

Start it with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

The repository `docker-compose.yml` is intended for local source builds and development. It bind-mounts the source tree into `/app`; do not use that file for a stable install unless you intentionally want live source edits inside the container.

## Unraid

The Unraid user-template XML lives at `Documentation/unraid/podcast-ad-remover.xml`. It uses the published `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest` image, maps `/data` to `/mnt/user/appdata/podcast-ad-remover`, and exposes port `8000`.

## Data Volume

Mount `/data` and back it up before upgrades.

Important paths:

- `/data/db/podcasts.db`: SQLite database.
- `/data/podcasts/`: podcast and episode artifacts.
- `/data/feeds/`: generated RSS files.
- `/data/models/`: downloaded local model files.
- `/data/app.log`: application log.

Do not delete `/data` unless you intentionally want to remove the app database and downloaded podcasts.

## Notifications

Admin notifications are optional and off by default. Configure them from **Admin > Notifications** after the app is running.

The app embeds the Apprise Python library, so no extra container is required for most setups. Add one Apprise URL per line and use the test button before relying on alerts. Examples of supported targets include:

- ntfy for simple mobile/web push, including self-hosted ntfy servers;
- Gotify for a self-hosted notification server;
- Pushover for low-maintenance hosted push;
- Discord, Telegram, Slack, email/SMTP, and webhook targets.

Notification URLs can contain bearer tokens, webhook IDs, usernames, or passwords. Treat them as deployment secrets and avoid sharing screenshots of the Notifications page.

## Building From Source

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

For a local image without Compose:

```bash
docker build -t podcast-ad-remover:local .
```

The default image includes Piper TTS and is intended primarily for `linux/amd64`. Experimental Apple Silicon / ARM64 builds can skip Piper TTS:

```bash
npm run docker:experimental:arm64 -- --push
```

This path targets `linux/arm64`, tags the image as `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:experimental-arm64`, and sets `INSTALL_TTS=0`. Piper is unavailable in that image, but spoken summaries and title intros can still be tested by selecting Gemini TTS and configuring a Gemini API key. Podcast download, transcription, ad detection, cutting, feed generation, and the web UI remain the intended test surface.

## Release Publishing

Before upgrading an existing install with important data, dry-run database migrations against a copy:

```bash
npm run db:migration-dry-run -- --db-path /path/to/data/db/podcasts.db
```

The command copies the database to a temporary data directory and runs the normal startup migration path there without modifying the source database.

Before publishing:

```bash
npm run verify:docker
```

To publish the current version from `package.json`:

```bash
npm run docker:publish
```

This pushes both:

- `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:<version>`
- `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest`
