# Project Index

Podcast Ad Remover downloads podcast episodes, processes them to remove ads or promotional segments, and republishes RSS feeds that can be subscribed to from a podcast client.

## Current Stack

- Python 3.11, FastAPI, Jinja templates, SQLite.
- FFmpeg for audio cutting and concatenation.
- Whisper/faster-whisper for local transcription.
- Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter for LLM-based segment detection.
- Apprise for optional admin notifications.
- Tailwind CSS compiled with npm.
- Docker for normal deployment.

## Important Folders

- `app/main.py`: application entry point and processor process startup.
- `app/core/`: podcast, audio, AI, RSS, search, and processing logic.
- `app/infra/`: SQLite initialization and repository access.
- `app/web/`: web routes, templates, authentication helpers, and static files.
- `app/api/`: subscription and audio endpoints.
- `Documentation/`: architecture, deployment, release, and maintenance docs.
- `scripts/`: verification, migration dry-run, and Docker release helpers.
- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: container build and local compose configuration.

## Common Commands

```bash
npm ci
npm run build:css
npm run verify
npm run verify:docker
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:publish
npm run docker:experimental:arm64
docker compose up -d --build
```

`npm run verify` is the normal pre-change completion check. `npm run verify:docker` adds a local Docker image build and should be used before release tagging or publishing.
