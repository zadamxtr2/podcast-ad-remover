# Resource Audit

Date: 2026-06-10
Branch: `audit-work`

## Summary

The Docker image was larger than necessary. The previous image was about 3.25 GB. A local optimized build is about 1.6 GB, mainly by removing the unused PyTorch install and keeping local development artifacts out of the image.

The app itself is small. The heavy parts are:

- FFmpeg and its Debian runtime libraries.
- `faster-whisper`, CTranslate2, PyAV, tokenizers, and NumPy.
- Piper TTS, ONNX Runtime, and phonemizer libraries when local TTS is installed.
- Downloaded Whisper and Piper models under `/data/models`.
- Processed podcast audio under `/data/podcasts`.

Idle memory in a smoke container was about 200 MB before loading Whisper or Piper models. Processing memory and CPU will be much higher while transcribing, detecting ads, cutting audio, or generating TTS.

Live measurements from the current deployment while transcription was active:

```text
podcast-ad-remover CPU: 344.68%
podcast-ad-remover memory: 1.163 GiB / 8 GiB
worker process RSS: about 1.0 GiB
uvicorn process RSS: about 325 MiB
/data total: 2.2 GB
/data/podcasts: 1.9 GB
/data/models: 251 MB
```

This is not evidence of runaway resource use. It is consistent with a single active Whisper transcription using about three to four CPU cores and holding the base model plus runtime working memory. The 3% CPU observed earlier is acceptable idle/background activity for this deployment.

For the current maintainer's deployment, high CPU during transcription is acceptable because it finishes CPU-bound work faster. Podcast storage and the Piper model footprint are not current priorities.

## Findings

### Image Size

Measured locally:

```text
jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:1.3.1     3.25 GB
podcast-ad-remover:resource-audit  1.60 GB
```

The old image included:

- Explicit CPU PyTorch install: about 1.03 GB layer.
- Full `torch` package in site-packages: about 754 MB.
- `torchvision` and `torchaudio`, neither imported by the application.
- Local `node_modules` copied into `/app`: about 23 MB.
- Git and wget installed in the runtime image.

The optimized image keeps:

- FFmpeg.
- `faster-whisper` and CTranslate2.
- Piper TTS and ONNX Runtime.
- AI provider SDKs.
- FastAPI/Jinja/SQLite runtime dependencies.

### Runtime Disk Use

Disk use is dominated by persistent `/data`, not the application code:

- `/data/db/podcasts.db`: SQLite metadata.
- `/data/podcasts`: processed audio, transcripts, reports, generated summaries.
- `/data/feeds`: generated RSS files.
- `/data/models`: downloaded Whisper and Piper models.
- `/data/backups`: migration backups.

The largest ongoing disk growth source is retained processed audio. This is worth making visible, but it is not currently a priority to shrink because the live `/data` size is reasonable for the host.

### Runtime CPU and Memory

Expected hotspots:

- Whisper/faster-whisper transcription.
- FFmpeg decoding, cutting, and concatenation.
- LLM provider requests, mostly waiting on network/API rather than CPU.
- Piper TTS when title intros or audio summaries are enabled with the local provider. Gemini TTS moves that work to the Gemini API and uses speech quotas instead of local Piper/ONNX runtime.

The app already has a `concurrent_downloads` setting, but that is really processing concurrency. One concurrent job can still fan out into FFmpeg and Whisper internal threads. Small machines should usually use `concurrent_downloads=1`.

The audit branch adds optional controls for `whisper_cpu_threads` and `ffmpeg_threads`, both defaulting to `0` for automatic/full-speed behavior. It also adds `unload_whisper_after_job`, which unloads the Faster-Whisper model once the queue is empty. That can reduce idle RAM after processing, with the tradeoff that the next transcription must reload the already-downloaded local model first. The app logs the measured reload time as `Model loaded in X.XXs`.

## Changes Made

- Removed explicit `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` install from `Dockerfile`.
- Changed apt install to `--no-install-recommends` and removed runtime `git`/`wget`.
- Added `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`.
- Added `.dockerignore` entries for `node_modules`, tests, local agent files, and virtualenvs.
- Moved pytest from production `requirements.txt` to `requirements-dev.txt`.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Measure Whisper reload time on the live container after enabling `Unload Whisper After Jobs`.
2. Add optional image variants only if image size becomes a real operational problem:
   - `standard`: current full transcription plus Piper support.
   - `no-tts`: remove Piper and ONNX Runtime for users who do not use local audio summaries or title intros.
   - `experimental-arm64`: Apple Silicon / ARM64 test image using `INSTALL_TTS=0` because Piper's phonemizer dependency is not currently simple to install from Linux arm64 wheels. Gemini TTS can still provide spoken summaries/title intros on this image if API quota is available.
   - potentially `external-transcription`: for users who do not want local Whisper.
3. Add UI controls for existing download guardrails:
   - minimum free disk space
   - maximum episode download size
4. Make cleanup safer and more visible:
   - show retained episode count per podcast
   - show estimated disk reclaimed before deleting files
   - expand stale artifact cleanup if future staged processing introduces `.work` directories

## Commands For A Real Container Audit

Run these on the PC hosting the live Docker container.

Find the container name:

```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

Check image size:

```bash
docker images --format "table {{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}" | grep podcast
```

Check live CPU, memory, and block I/O:

```bash
docker stats <container-name> --no-stream
```

Check persistent data size:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> sh -lc 'du -h -d 2 /data | sort -h'
```

Check model sizes:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> sh -lc 'du -h -d 2 /data/models | sort -h'
```

Check podcast storage sizes:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> sh -lc 'du -h -d 2 /data/podcasts | sort -h | tail -30'
```

Check database and backup sizes:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> sh -lc 'du -h /data/db /data/backups 2>/dev/null || true'
```

Check idle process memory inside the container:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> sh -lc 'ps -o pid,ppid,rss,pcpu,comm,args | sort -k3 -n'
```

If a job is actively processing, run this several times a minute:

```bash
docker stats <container-name> --no-stream
docker exec <container-name> sh -lc 'du -h -d 2 /data | sort -h | tail -30'
```

Send back the outputs if deeper tuning is needed.
