# Verification

Verification is the minimum set of repeatable checks to run before merging, tagging, or publishing a Docker image.

## Setup

Install Node dependencies before running frontend-related checks:

```bash
npm ci
```

Python dependencies are normally installed through Docker. For local Python work, install `requirements.txt` in your chosen virtual environment.
For local verification and tests, install the development requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Standard Check

Run:

```bash
npm run verify
```

`npm test` runs the same standard verification gate.

This currently performs:

- Python syntax compilation for `app/` and `scripts/`.
- Python unit tests with `pytest`.
- Tailwind CSS rebuild from `app/web/static/css/input.css` to `app/web/static/css/output.css`.
- Frontend dependency audit with `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`.

If Tailwind reports stale Browserslist data, refresh the lockfile metadata with:

```bash
npx update-browserslist-db@latest
```

This is a maintenance update only; confirm the resulting `package-lock.json` changes are limited to Browserslist-related dependency metadata.

## Docker Check

Run this before a version increment or release publish:

```bash
npm run verify:docker
```

This runs the standard check and builds a local image tagged `podcast-ad-remover:verify`.

## Migration Dry Run

Before upgrading a valuable existing install, validate migrations against a copy of the database:

```bash
npm run db:migration-dry-run -- --db-path /data/db/podcasts.db
```

To keep the migrated copy for inspection:

```bash
npm run db:migration-dry-run -- --db-path /data/db/podcasts.db --keep-copy /tmp/podcast-ad-remover-migration-check
```

The helper copies the source database into a temporary data directory, runs the normal startup migration path on the copy, and does not modify the source database.

## Pull Request Check

GitHub Actions runs `npm run verify` on pull requests and pushes to `main` and `audit-work`. The workflow sets `DATA_DIR` to a temporary runner directory so tests do not depend on `/data` being writable.

## Release Publish Check

The release helper reads the version from `package.json`, validates that it is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, runs verification, and builds two tags:

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

To push to Docker Hub:

```bash
npm run docker:publish
```

The pushed tags are:

- `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:<version>`
- `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest`

## Experimental Docker Tags

For audit or trial builds that must not update `latest` or a version tag:

```bash
npm run docker:experimental -- --push
```

By default this publishes:

- `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:experimental`
- `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:audit-work`
- `jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:audit-work-<git-sha>`

The helper refuses `latest` and SemVer-looking tags.

## Current Gaps

- Python test coverage is intentionally small and should be expanded before broad processor refactors.
- There is no automated migration test against a realistic copy of an existing `podcasts.db`; add this before making destructive or rename-style schema changes.
