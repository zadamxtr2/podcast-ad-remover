# Podcast Ad Remover

Podcast Ad Remover is a self-hosted app for downloading podcast episodes, removing ad and promo segments, and publishing replacement RSS feeds that can be subscribed to from a normal podcast client.

It is built for homelab-style deployment: one Docker container, SQLite state under `/data`, local transcription with WhisperX, FFmpeg audio editing, and LLM-backed ad detection through Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter.

## Current UI

### Dashboard

The dashboard shows My Podcasts or the global Library, processing state, unified feed links, saved storage, and per-podcast feed links.

### Episode Management

Episode pages expose reprocessing, manual downloads, ignore/delete actions, AI summaries, descriptions, playback, and podcast-client subscription links.

### Public Subscribe Page

The optional `/subscribe` page is read-only and designed for people who only need to subscribe to existing feeds. It does not allow adding, editing, reprocessing, or deleting podcasts.

### Operations Dashboard

The admin queue shows active jobs, queued/retry states, disk usage, next feed checks, and recently processed items.

- FFmpeg-based audio cutting and rewritten RSS feed generation.
- Per-podcast feeds plus a unified feed.
- Optional AI episode summaries and spoken title intros using either local Piper TTS or Gemini TTS.
- Durable SQLite-backed processing jobs with retry and rate-limit states.
- Admin queue/operations dashboard.
- Optional token-protected AI/automation REST API with scoped tokens and configurable rate limits.
- Optional management login.
- Optional feed/audio authentication with generated feed tokens.
- Optional public read-only subscribe page for frictionless podcast-client setup.
- Optional Apprise-backed admin notifications for access requests, new podcasts, completed episodes, and breaking processing errors.
- Resource controls for WhisperX CPU threads, FFmpeg threads, and unloading WhisperX after jobs.

## Quick Start

### Docker Run

Run the published image and mount `/data` somewhere persistent:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name podcast-ad-remover \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  -e SESSION_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000" \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key" \
  jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`, then go to **Admin > AI Settings > Text Analysis** to confirm your provider and model settings.

Keep `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` stable once set. Changing it can invalidate browser sessions and signed feed tokens.

### Docker Compose

For local development from source:

```bash
cp env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

For a production-style compose file using the published image, see `docker-compose.prod.yml` and [Documentation/Deployment.md](Documentation/Deployment.md).

### Unraid

A dedicated Unraid template is included at `Documentation/unraid/podcast-ad-remover.xml`. See [Documentation/Unraid_Deployment.md](Documentation/Unraid_Deployment.md).

## AI Providers

Gemini is the recommended default for most personal installs because the free tier is usually enough for this app's transcript-analysis workload. Gemini direct access uses Google's OpenAI-compatible endpoint through the OpenAI Python SDK.

The default Gemini cascade is:

1. `gemini-3.5-flash`
2. `gemini-3-flash`
3. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
4. `gemini-2.5-flash`
5. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`

The app tries each configured model in order and falls back when a model is unavailable, fails, or hits a rate limit. OpenRouter uses the same order with `google/` model IDs.

Current Gemini free-tier limits recorded for these defaults:

| Model | Category | RPM | TPM | RPD |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | Text-out models | 5 | 250K | 20 |
| Gemini 3 Flash | Text-out models | 5 | 250K | 20 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite | Text-out models | 10 | 250K | 20 |
| Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite | Text-out models | 15 | 250K | 500 |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash | Text-out models | 5 | 250K | 20 |

You can set keys in the Admin UI or with environment variables:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

## Text-To-Speech

Piper remains the default TTS provider because it is local and does not consume API quota. Admins can optionally switch spoken title intros and audio summaries to Gemini TTS from **Admin > AI Settings > Voice and TTS**.

Gemini TTS uses the saved Gemini API keys and this default fallback order:

1. `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`
2. `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`

Available Gemini voices are `Orus` (default), `Enceladus`, and `Laomedeia`. Current free-tier limits recorded for each Gemini TTS model are 3 RPM, 10K TPM, and 10 RPD.

## Authentication And Feed Access

The app supports separate choices for management access and podcast feed access:

- Management pages can require login.
- The public `/subscribe` page can remain available without login.
- Feeds and audio can remain unauthenticated for the smoothest podcast-client setup.
- Feed/audio authentication can be enabled when you want clients to use credentials or generated feed-token URLs.

Protected feed URLs containing `token=` are bearer secrets. Anyone with the full URL can read that feed and download audio until the token is revoked.

## AI API

Admins can enable an optional REST API under `/api/v1` from **Admin > System Settings**. API clients use separate `par_...` bearer tokens with scoped access (`read`, `write`, `process`, `admin`) and SQLite-backed per-token/IP rate limits. See [Documentation/API.md](Documentation/API.md).

## Admin Notifications

Notifications are off by default. Admins can enable them from **Admin > Notifications** by adding one or more Apprise URLs and selecting which events should send alerts.

Initial supported events are:

- user access requested
- new podcast added to the global library
- episode processed and available in feeds
- breaking processing errors, including max-retry failures and top-level worker errors

Apprise supports many targets, including ntfy, Gotify, Pushover, Discord, Telegram, Slack, email/SMTP, webhooks, and SMS providers. Treat notification URLs as secrets because many contain tokens or webhook credentials.

## Persistent Data

Mount `/data` in Docker. It contains:

- `/data/db/podcasts.db`
- `/data/podcasts/`
- `/data/feeds/`
- `/data/models/`
- `/data/backups/`
- logs

Database migrations are designed to preserve existing installs. Formal migrations create backups under `/data/backups/` before applying schema changes.

## Verification

Before completing code changes:

```bash
npm run verify
```

For Docker/release work:

```bash
npm run verify:docker
```

Experimental branch images can be published without touching `latest`:

```bash
npm run docker:experimental -- --push --tag experimental
```

Experimental Apple Silicon / ARM64 images can be built without Piper TTS:

```bash
npm run docker:experimental:arm64 -- --push
```

`linux/amd64` remains the primary release target. The ARM64 experimental image skips Piper because its phonemizer dependency is not currently available as a simple Linux arm64 wheel. Podcast download, local transcription, ad detection, cutting, feeds, and the web UI remain the target feature set. Spoken summaries and title intros can still be tested on no-Piper images by selecting Gemini TTS and configuring a Gemini API key.

Release publishing is explicit and tags both the version and `latest`:

```bash
npm run docker:publish
```
