# Podcast Ad Remover (AGPAR) v1.3.1
This is an app that downloads podcasts, uses AI to remove ads, and then creates a new feed that you can consume them from. 
I mainly vibe-coded for my own personal use and it seems to be working pretty well so I thought I would share it. I've been using it fora bout a month and had a couple of friends also using it and we're pretty hapopy with how it's going. For the most part it just works. I'm sure there are heaps of things that aren't up to a professional standard, but for running on my own homelab it has worked great. 

The Audio transcription happens locally using Whisper which can be fairly processing ehavy, but I run it on the CPU on a little N100 machine and it stil manages to work at something like 3x real speed. I do reccomend pinning it to some subset of your CPU cores because othwerwise you may well freeze the PC.

The ad detection uses LLMs. I use Gemini because the free tier is very generous and enough to very easuily manage the API calls this app makes. I only built in support for other models out of curiosity and I haven't tested them rigorously at all.

## Features

-   **Automatic Ad Detection**: Uses state-of-the-art LLMs (Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or OpenRouter) to intelligently identify ads, sponsor reads, and promotional segments.
-   **Audio Processing**: Uses **Whisper** for accurate transcription and **FFmpeg** for precise audio cutting.
-   **Seamless Playback**: Generates custom RSS feeds for every subscription. Add them to your favorite podcast player (Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, etc.) to listen ad-free.
-   **Smart Enhancements**: 
    -   **Intro/Outro Removal**: Option to trim standard podcast intros/outros.
    -   **Whitelist Mode**: Toggle to keep only speech content, stripping intro music, jingles, and non-speech audio.
    -   **AI Summaries**: Generate and append spoken AI summaries to the start of episodes.
    -   **Custom "Title Intros"**: Adds a "You're listening to..." intro for context.
-   **Robust Management**:
    -   Processing queue with pause/resume/cancel/retry capabilities.
    -   Manual "Reprocess" option to try different settings.
    -   Full admin dashboard for managing subscriptions and viewing logs.

## Quick Start

### Docker Run (Fastest)

Run the application directly from Docker Hub without cloning the repository:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name podcast-ad-remover \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  jdcb4/podcast-ad-remover:latest
```

### Docker Compose (Build from Source)

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create a `.env` file (see `env.example`):
    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```
3.  Run with Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
4.  Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`.
5.  Navigate to **Settings > AI Models** to configure your API key.

### Getting a Free Gemini API Key

This application recommends using Google Gemini (Flash model) as it is currently free and very fast.

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Click **Create API key**.
4.  Search for "Google Cloud Platform" project or create a new one if prompted.
5.  Copy the generated key (starts with `AIza...`).
6.  Paste this key into the application settings.

### Default Gemini Fallback

The default Gemini model cascade is ordered for the current free-tier Flash/Lite models:

1. `gemini-3.5-flash`
2. `gemini-3-flash`
3. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
4. `gemini-2.5-flash`
5. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`

The app tries each model in order and falls back when a model is unavailable, fails, or hits a rate limit. The current free-tier limits used for this default are:

| Model | Category | RPM | TPM | RPD |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | Text-out models | 3 / 5 | 50.11K / 250K | 9 / 20 |
| Gemini 3 Flash | Text-out models | 2 / 5 | 41.07K / 250K | 9 / 20 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite | Text-out models | 1 / 10 | 61.8K / 250K | 6 / 20 |
| Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite | Text-out models | 1 / 15 | 68.66K / 250K | 5 / 500 |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash | Text-out models | 0 / 5 | 0 / 250K | 0 / 20 |

If the first model is not available on your account or quota tier, the cascade should move on to the next configured model automatically.

### Unraid

A dedicated Unraid template is included (`podcast-ad-remover.xml`). Add the template to your Docker templates URL or copy it to your flash drive. See [Documentation/Unraid_Deployment.md](Documentation/Unraid_Deployment.md) for details.
